## **Overview**

After practicing creating Tableau stories, we will create a story for our investors. The purpose of this story is to help them determine whether they should invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

For this analysis, we will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a "datetime" datatype. Using Tableau we will:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
